# Auto-encoder

## Overview
This project implements an Auto-encoder, a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. Auto-encoders are designed to encode input data into a compressed representation and then reconstruct the original data from this representation.

## Features
- Dimensionality reduction
- Data reconstruction
- Customizable architecture 

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Train the Auto-encoder:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
2. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## File Structure
- `train.py`: Script for training the Auto-encoder.
- `evaluate.py`: Script for evaluating the model.
- `models/`: Contains model definitions.
- `data/`: Directory for input data.
